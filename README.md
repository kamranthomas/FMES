# FMES
Repository containing the code for the Pop Up project.
Main branch should always be stable. To develop code create a branch and use that for new things. Merge back to the main once you're done.

# Naming Conventions

- Module (python file) names - lowercase with underscores instead of spaces.

- Variable names and function/method names - also be lowercase with underscores to separate words.

- Class names - CamelCase (uppercase letter to start with, words run together, each starting with an uppercase letter, Example: MyClass, ).

- Module constants should be all uppercase.

- E.g. You would typically have module.ClassName.method_name.
